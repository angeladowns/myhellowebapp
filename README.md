### Sasebo Code Club Project
We purchased the book and began working on this tutorial in April (2017) as an introduction to Django and Python.

## Notes
Before starting Chapter 4, take a few minutes to:
- [ ] read https://github.com/hellowebapp/hellowebapp/tree/master/git-tips and set up your .gitignore file
- [ ] create a README.md file in the top level directory
- [ ] set up a GitHub repository
